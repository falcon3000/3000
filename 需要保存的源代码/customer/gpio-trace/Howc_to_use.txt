# How to Use

This gpio-trace app can check value of DI_0(gpio421), Before execute this app, make 
sure DI_0 was 0(no input connect to to DI_0).

This app test on jp4.6, jp5.0.2 was not tested.

- cpoy `select_notify.c` to IPC520A

- build select_notify.c
  gcc select_notify.c  -o gpio-trace

- execute app
  sudo ./gpio-trace

- test if it can shutdown success.
  1. Connect DI_0 with low
  1. Check default value `sudo cat /sys/class/gpio/gpio421/value`, 
		value should be 0 when input was low
  1. Provide a high signal to DI_0. now IPC520A should be power off right now.

To add more function when DI_0 was high, refer "call_shutdown()"  to add wanted function, like: save data, close app...
